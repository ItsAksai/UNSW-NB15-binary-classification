### UNSW-NB15 Binary Classification

The project is my first and deals with binary classification on the UNSW-NB15 dataset provided by [UNSW Sydney](https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/personal/z5025758_ad_unsw_edu_au/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fz5025758_ad_unsw_edu_au%2FDocuments%2FUNSW-NB15%20dataset&ga=1) which is used for network intrusion detection tasks. The repository consists of two jupyter notebook files, One for preprocessing of the data and the other for training the machine learning algorithms

# Files :

1. Preprocessing.ipnyb:
Loading, cleanning, formatting, transforming of the dataset along with use of functions to streamline the process

2.ML.ipnyb:
Applying various machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) and functions to visualise and tabulate the results
